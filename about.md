This blog is a repository used to share advice about the tools and practices I use for programming, as well as insights on the topics I work on. Since it is currently hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), you can find the source code for this blog on [GitHub itself](https://github.com/theodz/theodz.github.io).

You can find more about me by following me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheoDzierzbicki) or [GitHub](https://github.com/theodz).
