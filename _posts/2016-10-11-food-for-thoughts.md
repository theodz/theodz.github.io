Sometimes you come across stuff while browsing that make you ponder. You don't have an use for them right away, but you're not sure you'll be able to find them again when you do. I used to use bookmarks to keep track of all these links, but I found out the hard way that they don't always survive system migration very well. Archiving seems a better answer, and what better place for that than this wonderful blog?

So here comes my personal link collection for (possible) future use. I don't expect it to be of use to anyone else, but if you want to you can have a look anyway!
